ContactManager Application Uses the Fake REST JsonAPI Jsonplaceholder

TechStack Used
1. React.js
2. Context API (refer the docs to learn how it works)
3. React-Router 4 for Single Page Application

The persistence of the data is not possible due to JSONplaceholder being a fake REST api does not allow manipulation in its database
